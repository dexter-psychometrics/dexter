abstract = { This study is about relations between classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). It is shown that CTT is based on the assumption that measures are exchangeable, whereas IRT is based on conditional independence. Thus, IRT is presented as an extension of CTT, and concepts from both theories are related to one another. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that IRT can be used to provide CTT statistics in situations where CTT fails. Reliability, for instance, can be determined even though a test was not administered to the intended population. }

ABSTRACT={In this paper test equating is considered as a missing data problem. The unobserved responses of the reference population to the new test must be imputed to specify a new cutscore. The proportion of students from the reference population that would have failed the new exam and those having failed the reference exam are made approximately the same.  We investigate whether item response theory (IRT) makes it possible to identify the distribution of these missing responses and the distribution of test scores from the observed data without parametric assumptions for the ability distribution. We show that while  the score distribution is not fully identifiable, the uncertainty about the score distribution on the new test due to non-identifiability is very small. Moreover, ignoring the non-identifiability issue and assuming a normal distribution for ability may lead to bias in test equating, which we illustrate in simulated and empirical data examples.}

abstract="This paper discusses the issue of differential item functioning (DIF) in international surveys. DIF is likely to occur in international surveys. What is needed is a statistical approach that takes DIF into account, while at the same time allowing for meaningful comparisons between countries. Some existing approaches are discussed and an alternative is provided. The core of this alternative approach is to define the construct as a large set of items, and to report in terms of summary statistics. Since the data are incomplete, measurement models are used to complete the incomplete data. For that purpose, different models can be used across countries. The method is illustrated with PISA's reading literacy data. The results indicate that this approach fits the data better than the current PISA methodology; however, the league tables are nearly identical. The implications for monitoring changes over time are discussed.",

abstract = "Responses to items from an intelligence test may be fast or slow. The research issue dealt with in this paper is whether the intelligence involved in fast correct responses differs in nature from the intelligence involved in slow correct responses. There are two questions related to this issue: 1. Are the processes involved different? 2. Are the abilities involved different? An answer to these questions is provided making use of data from a Raven-like matrices test and a verbal analogies test, and the use of a psychometric branching model. The branching model is based on three latent traits: speed, fast accuracy and slow accuracy, and item parameters corresponding to each of these. The pattern of item difficulties is used to draw conclusions on the cognitive processes involved. The results are as follows: 1. The processes involved in fast and slow responses can be differentiated, as can be derived from qualitative differences in the patterns of item difficulty, and fast responses lead to a larger differentiation between items than slow responses do. 2. The abilities underlying fast and slow responses can also be differentiated, and fast responses allow for a better differentiation between the respondents."

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper describes an approach to item analysis that is based on the estimation of a set of response curves for each item. The response curves show, at a glance, the difficulty and the discriminating power of the item and the popularity of each distractor, at any level of the criterion variable (e.g., total score). The curves are estimated by Gaussian kernel smoothing, a weighted moving average process with a parameter that can be varied at the user's discretion. The response curve for the correct answer can be accompanied by curves indicating a confidence region. The response curves also form the basis for estimating item statistics for any group of examinees for which the distribution of the criterion variable is known.}
